# Remove Cookie Dialogs

Some sites issue a pop up dialog to ask permission to create cookies. This was made much, much more prevalent after GDPR. Given that my browser deletes all cache/cookies anyways it's a (albeit small) waste of time over and over and over. I've started ignoring them, but some actually overlap the page I'm on making the site useless until a click is issued. This project is my attempt to stop this.
